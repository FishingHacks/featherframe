## Reporting a Vulnerability

Did you found a Security Vulnerability? Create a Proof-of-concept and show it to us in issues.
Add an description on what happens, what do you expect and/or why do you think it is a vulnerability.
To help us fix it faster, you can take an educated guess, on what's causing the issue.

That's really all.
